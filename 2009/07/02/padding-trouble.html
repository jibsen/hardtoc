  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When Intel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_386">expanded the 8086 architecture to 32-bit</a> in 1985, they
extended the 16-bit registers present to 32-bit registers. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ax</code> became <code class="highlighter-rouge">eax</code>,
but it was still possible to use the low 16 bits of <code class="highlighter-rouge">eax</code> as <code class="highlighter-rouge">ax</code> just like
before. Their choice was that performing operations on the low 16 bits did not
change the high 16 bits of the register.</p>

<p>AMD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">expanded the 32-bit architecture to 64-bit</a> in 2003. This was
again a superset of the original, making it backwards compatible. They extended
the 32-bit registers to 64-bit, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">eax</code> became <code class="highlighter-rouge">rax</code>. Again it was possible
to to perform operations on the low 32 bits, but doing so clears the high 32
bits of the register.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Operations that output to a 32-bit subregister are automatically
zero-extended to the entire 64-bit register. Operations that output to 8-bit
or 16-bit subregisters are not zero-extended (this is compatible x86
behavior). <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc267760.aspx">[source]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now both choices work as far as backwards compatibility goes, and as long as we
as programmers are aware of what happens, neither is a problem.</p>

<p>When building the <a href="http://www.ibsensoftware.com/products_aPLib.html">aPLib compression library</a>, I use Visual C++ to
generate assembly listings, which I then perform some changes on with a Perl
script, before assembling the object files. While working on the recently
released 64-bit version, I ran into a problem – the debug build of the library
worked fine, but the release build did not.</p>

<p>Bugs like this are often caused by some improper memory usage, so I spent a day
trying to track down the problem without much luck. Somehow the contents of a
register was corrupted.</p>

<p>Looking through the code in <a href="http://www.hiew.ru/">HIEW</a> I finally found the cause; a seemingly
random instruction that wrote to the 32-bit part of a register, thereby
clearing the high 32 bits. Then it dawned on me.</p>

<p>Visual C++ emits padding macros into assembly listings to align code and
improve performance. These macros, <code class="highlighter-rouge">npad</code>, are defined in a file called
<code class="highlighter-rouge">listing.inc</code> which resides in the Visual C++ include folder. But there is no
64-bit version of this file!</p>

<p>Let’s have a look then:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">;; LISTING.INC

;; non destructive nops
npad macro size
if size eq 1
  nop
else
 if size eq 2
   mov edi, edi
 else
   ...</code></pre></figure>

<p>And there we have it. An instruction like <code class="highlighter-rouge">mov edi, edi</code> is safe to use as
padding in 32-bit code, because moving the register to itself has no effect.
But if you insert it in 64-bit code, it all of a sudden has an effect – the
high 32 bits of <code class="highlighter-rouge">rdi</code> are cleared.</p>

<p>I have reported the problem to Microsoft and they say it will be addressed in a
future release.</p>

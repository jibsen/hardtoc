  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Raymond Chen recently <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/09/17/10063629.aspx">blogged</a> about the way CommandLineToArgvW treats
quotes and backslashes. Parsing the command-line into <code class="highlighter-rouge">argv[]</code> is something I
have had to fight with as well, so besides pointing to Raymond’s excellent
post, I wanted to add a few comments of my own here.</p>

<p>We are examining how command-line arguments with spaces and quotes are handled.
Part of the problem comes from the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29">DOS/Windows uses backslash as
separator in paths</a>. On systems like Unix, where forward slash is used
instead, using backslash to escape special characters is less of a problem. But
if you ever put a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247.aspx">Windows path</a> in a C string literal, you may have
run into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_toothpick_syndrome">LTS</a> – the situation where a string becomes unreadable due to
escape characters.</p>

<p>Microsoft fixed this in C# with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/362314fe.aspx">verbatim string literals</a>. C# also
implements a simpler method of escaping a quote inside a quoted string –
doubling it – which is used in languages like Pascal and BASIC, and is what
Raymond’s second hypothetical set of rules suggest.</p>

<p>The compromise we get for parsing command-line arguments in the C runtime
library (and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776391.aspx"><code class="highlighter-rouge">CommandLineToArgvW()</code></a>) is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a1y7w461.aspx">documented on MSDN</a>.
What the MSDN documentation does not tell you is that there is a second
mechanism for inserting a literal quote in a quoted string – or at least there
might be, depending on which version of the C runtime library.</p>

<p>In Visual C++ 2.0 from 1994, the command-line parser handles two quotes inside
a quoted string as an escape. What it does is that it copies the second quote
and switches to unquoted mode. Thus you can insert a literal quote inside a
quoted string by putting three quotes (two to insert the literal quote, and one
more to put you back into quoted mode).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">DQUOTECHAR</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">inquote</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">DQUOTECHAR</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>    <span class="cm">/* Double quote inside quoted string */</span>
        <span class="k">else</span>        <span class="cm">/* skip first quote char and copy second */</span>
            <span class="n">copychar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="n">copychar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>       <span class="cm">/* don't copy quote */</span>

    <span class="n">inquote</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">inquote</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This code is present until Visual C++ 8.0 from 2005, where it is changed so the
two quote escape sequence no longer switches mode. That means that to insert a
literal quote inside a quoted string, you now only need two quotes.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">DQUOTECHAR</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">inquote</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">DQUOTECHAR</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>    <span class="cm">/* Double quote inside quoted string */</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>    <span class="cm">/* skip first quote char and copy second */</span>
        <span class="n">copychar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>       <span class="cm">/* don't copy quote */</span>
        <span class="n">inquote</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">inquote</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
	<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This change is probably what is causing some confusion in the comments on
Raymond’s post – the twelve literal quotes in <code class="highlighter-rouge">foo""""""""""""bar</code> will result
in five quotes with the current parser (opening quote, five pairs, closing
quote), but only four with the older method (opening quote, three triples, and
a double quote).</p>

<p>The implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">CommandLineToArgvW()</code> in current versions of shell32.dll
use the older method. The same goes for the command-line parser used in GCC on
Windows (I checked 4.5.1).</p>

<p>Looking at the two code excerpts, one could wonder if the old handling was in
fact just a bug introduced by the else part not being in braces, and left in
for over ten years. Or maybe it was intentional, and the change in Visual C++
8.0 was to support the way two quotes are used as escape in other languages.</p>

<p>Either way, I find it interesting that this functionality was added (it wasn’t
supported in Visual C++ 1.52), and then changed in the C runtime library but
not in the API function, and not mentioned in the documentation of either.</p>
